Since money might be an issue for the sake of this class' replication project, an effect that does not require recruiting older adults is the donation from*kinship interaction affecting discount rates ($\kappa$ values). The authors report the effect size of the interaction as $\eta_p^2$=0.03, which is rather weak. However, they also report the mean $\kappa$ values in each age group, and the means of younger adults seem to be what drives the interaction.

In order to collect data correctly and efficiently, I am attempting to calculate the effect size of this interaction within the young asults group. I will first try to obtain the reported effect size ($\eta_p^2$=0.03) using the overall means and sd's , than apply the same procedure on the means and sd's reported for young adults. 

The authors report removing 35 cells (a cell represent $\kappa$ or *AUC* value in one of the 4 donation form * kinship conditions) from 27 participants prior to running their analyses. They do not indicate whether they removed these participants from the dataset altogether or just treated these removed cells as NAs but retained other cells from these participants. Out of caution and for implementation ease, I will simulate the data assuming that participants were removed from analysis all together, meaning that `r 155-27` participants provided full data.

#Simulate overall data
```{r}
df_overall=data.frame(
  subid=as.character(1:128),
  rel_mon=rnorm(n=128, mean=-1.87, sd=1.3),
  nonrel_mon=rnorm(n=128, mean = -1.99, sd=1.4),
  rel_time=rnorm(n=128, mean=-1.9, sd=1.53),
  nonrel_time=rnorm(n=128, mean=-1.77, sd=1.53)
)

#long-form
ovrl_lng=df_overall%>%gather('con','log_k',2:5)

#separate 'con' to 2 conditions (donation and kinship)
lng2=ovrl_lng%>%separate(con, c("kinship", "donation"))
```

#Repeated measures ANOVA
```{r}
anova_k=ezANOVA(data = lng2, wid=.(subid), dv=.(log_k), within  = .(donation, kinship), type = 3) #-> type=3 to emulate SPSS, indicate that age_grp is observed (rather than manipulated) to get more accurate eta_sq

kable(anova_k, align = 'c', digits = 3, caption = "Table 1: Donation form X Kinship interaction, overall data")

```

Everytime I simulated the data, the ANOVA reported above produces markedly different results, though the effect size always remain very small (ranges between 0.02 and 0). I thus do not believe that this is a stable effect worth pursuing.
